📌 POINTERS IN C++
1. What is a Pointer?

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

Syntax
datatype *pointerName;

Example
int x = 5;
int *p = &x;

Pointer Operators
Operator	Meaning
&	Address-of operator
*	Dereference operator
Accessing Data
Expression	Meaning
p	Address of x
*p	Value of x
&p	Address of pointer p
📌 TYPES OF POINTERS (6 TYPES)
1️⃣ Null Pointer

A pointer that does not point to any valid memory location.

int *p = nullptr;


Use: Prevents accidental access to random memory.

2️⃣ Wild Pointer

A pointer that is declared but not initialized.

int *p;   // wild pointer


Problem: Points to random memory → undefined behavior.

3️⃣ Dangling Pointer

A pointer that points to memory that has already been freed or deleted.

int *p = new int(10);
delete p;   // p is now dangling


Danger: Accessing it may crash the program.

4️⃣ Void Pointer

A pointer that can store the address of any data type.

void *p;
int x = 5;
p = &x;


Note: Must be typecast before dereferencing.

5️⃣ Function Pointer

A pointer that stores the address of a function.

void greet() {
    cout << "Hello";
}

void (*p)() = greet;
p();


Use: Callbacks, event handling, advanced programming.

6️⃣ Smart Pointer (Mention Only)

A special type of pointer that automatically manages memory.
