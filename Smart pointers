🧠 Smart Pointers
What is a Smart Pointer?

A smart pointer is a special pointer that:

Stores a memory address

Automatically deletes the memory

Keeps your program safe from memory problems

You don’t need to write delete yourself.

Why Smart Pointers are Better than Normal Pointers

Normal (raw) pointers:

Need delete manually

Can cause memory leaks

Are easy to misuse

Smart pointers:

Delete memory automatically

Prevent memory leaks

Are safer and cleaner

👉 So they save time and avoid mistakes.

Types of Smart Pointers (3)
1️⃣ unique_ptr

Only one pointer can own the memory.

unique_ptr<int> p = make_unique<int>(10);


Cannot be copied

Can be moved

Best for single ownership

2️⃣ shared_ptr

Many pointers can share the same memory.

shared_ptr<int> p1 = make_shared<int>(20);
shared_ptr<int> p2 = p1;


Memory is deleted when last pointer is gone

3️⃣ weak_ptr

Does not own memory.

weak_ptr<int> wp = p1;


Used with shared_ptr

Helps avoid memory issues

One-Line Summary

Smart pointers manage memory for you so you don’t have to worry about deleting it.
